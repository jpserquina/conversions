### What's it for

Yet another Google Chrome extension to help with the little things. Manifest V3 compliant.

All project logic is made with Typescript; utils files are untouched in Javascript.

Highlight and right-click some text on a webpage, select `Convert!`, and the extension will do its magic. (WIP - mobile / touch)

Current integrations work offline; later ones will  include online look-ups.

### Compiling locally

- Pull repo to local
- Run `npm start`
- Load `build` folder as an unpacked extension in Google Chrome
- (WIP: Firefox, Opera, and Edge)
